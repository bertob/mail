* "Conversations" combines the following views:
	* Inbox
	* Sent
	* Drafts
	* All messages

  Conversations has 3 sections that are arranged vertically:
  	* Current Conversations
  		Drafts for new messages and conversations with open response drafts 
  	* New Conversations
  		All conversations with unread messages that have no drafts in them
  	* History
  		All other conversations (even if they only contain sent messages with no response)
  
  Notes:
  	* Messages in the "Current" and "New" categories can be reordered by dragging, so they can be used as a to-do list. Thus, no priority system is required.
  	* 
  	
* "Starred" behaves as expected.

* "Trash" also contains spam emails. New emails that have been flagged as spam appear on top, in a separate section similar to the "New" section in "Conversations". Thus, emails that have been accidentally flagged as spam, can be discovered and unflagged easily.

* No formatting via UI. Markdown is supported, though generally formatting is not recommended.
