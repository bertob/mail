Accounts column
---------------

* "Conversations" combines the following views:
	* Inbox
	* Sent
	* Drafts
	* All messages
  	
* "Starred" behaves as expected.

* "Trash" also contains spam emails. New emails that have been flagged as spam appear on top, in a separate section similar to the "New" section in "Conversations". Thus, emails that have been accidentally flagged as spam, can be discovered and unflagged easily.

Conversation List
-----------------

Conversations are organized in 2 sections that are arranged vertically:
* Active Conversations:
	* New messages
	* Drafts for new messages
	* Conversations with open response drafts
* History:
		* All other conversations (even if they only contain sent messages with no response)

Notes:
* Messages in the "Active" category can be reordered by dragging, so it can be used as a to-do list. Thus, no priority system is required.
* When a message is opened it is not automatically marked as read. The user has to drag it into "History" to remove it from the to-do list.


Single conversation

Compose view
------------

* No formatting via UI. Markdown is supported, though generally formatting is not recommended.
* Attachments can be added by dragging and dropping files on the compose view.
